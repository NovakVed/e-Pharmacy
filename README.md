# e-Pharmacy
Project name is 'e-Pharmachy'. A site through which you can order, market and offer specific medicines. In the site there are 4 user roles. Those roles are divided into an administrator, who has absolute authority. He can manage the whole system himself. Moderator role is a person who pays daily bills, reviews and approves non-prescription drug requests (those approved by the administrator) sent from registered users. Role of a registered user is to submit a drug request, browse through all his bills (has a preview of all the statistics brought, sold and ordered). Lastly, non-registered users, who are quite limited with the things they can do on the site itself. Everything is explained in more detail on the page itself, which you can find in the navigation chart in the application itself.
 
The website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
